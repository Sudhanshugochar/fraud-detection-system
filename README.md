---

## 🤖 Model Used

- Classification model (Scikit-learn based)
- Pipeline includes preprocessing + model
- Stored as `fraud_detection_pipeline.pkl` for reuse

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics help measure:
- Fraud detection effectiveness
- False positive vs false negative balance

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Fraudulent transactions show distinct behavioral patterns
- Feature scaling and preprocessing improve accuracy
- ML pipelines help make predictions reusable and production-ready

---

## 🚀 Results

- Successfully detected fraudulent transactions
- Built a reusable ML pipeline
- Demonstrated real-world classification use case

---

## 🧩 What I Learned

- End-to-end fraud detection workflow
- Supervised classification techniques
- Importance of evaluation metrics in fraud problems
- Model serialization for deployment

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Try advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
- Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
- Real-time fraud detection system
