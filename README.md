# 🕵️ Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning

A machine learning–based fraud detection system designed to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in transactional data.  
This project focuses on classification logic, feature importance, and building an end-to-end ML pipeline.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fraud detection is a critical problem in finance, e-commerce, and banking systems.  
This project uses supervised machine learning to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate** based on historical data.

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand fraud detection logic
- Apply classification algorithms
- Build and save a reusable ML pipeline
- Evaluate model performance on real-world data
